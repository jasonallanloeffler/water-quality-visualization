# water-quality-visualization
This project analyzes and visualizes water quality data using Python. It includes a dataset of water measurements such as pH, dissolved oxygen, phosphate levels, conductivity, and temperature. The primary visualization is a scatter plot comparing dissolved oxygen levels with temperature, helping to identify potential environmental patterns.
